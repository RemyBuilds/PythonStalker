Change the Keepa API key, and discord webhook to yours they are blank by default.



Create a folder and put this in the folder to contain the seller csv files, then create a stores.csv file to store your tracked stores in.

should look like this

randomfolder
    ----> stores.csv(you can add them as a batch to the CSV, or individually by the gui) + moneyprinter.py + it will generate files with the seller ID, don't freak out, means it is working

the first time it is run, there will be no "new asins" just getting a baseline to compare things to.

Thanks,
Remy
